## Overview

This repository contains a project dedicated to the analysis and forecasting of Meta Platforms, Inc. (ticker symbol: META) stock price using Python. The project is structured to showcase different levels of analysis, from a foundational approach to a more advanced exploration.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following analyses:

* **Beginner-Friendly Analysis (Notebook: `initial_meta_stock_analysis.ipynb`)**: This notebook provides an introductory analysis of Meta's stock price. It covers fundamental steps such as data acquisition, basic preprocessing, initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of a basic ARIMA model for short-term forecasting. This analysis is designed to be accessible and demonstrates core time series concepts.

* **Advanced Analysis (Notebook: `meta_stock_analysis_advanced.ipynb`)**: This notebook delves into a more in-depth analysis of Meta's stock price. It builds upon the foundational work by incorporating advanced techniques such as detailed financial ratio trend analysis, correlation studies, consideration of potential external factors, exploration of alternative forecasting models (e.g., SARIMA), and more robust model evaluation and validation methodologies. This analysis highlights a more sophisticated understanding of time series analysis and financial data.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2.  **Installation:** Install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn
    ```
3.  **Running the Code:**
    * Clone this repository.
    * Open either `initial_meta_stock_analysis.ipynb` for the beginner-friendly analysis or `meta_stock_analysis_advanced.ipynb` for the more in-depth exploration using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    * Run the cells sequentially in the desired notebook.

## Emphasizing Skill Progression

This project intentionally includes two separate analyses to demonstrate a progression of skills in financial data analysis and time series forecasting. Viewers can observe the foundational techniques in the `initial_meta_stock_analysis.ipynb` and then see a more comprehensive and sophisticated approach in the `meta_stock_analysis_advanced.ipynb`.

## Contributing

Suggestions and feedback are welcome, especially on potential improvements or further avenues of analysis.

**How to Update Your `README.md`:**

1.  **Edit Locally:** Open your `README.md` file in a text editor.
2.  **Replace Content:** Replace the existing content with the updated template above, ensuring the notebook file names match yours.
3.  **Save:** Save the changes to your `README.md` file.
4.  **Stage, Commit, and Push:** In your terminal, navigate to your repository and run:

    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Updated README to emphasize beginner and advanced analyses."
    git push origin main
    ```

By updating your `README.md` in this way, you clearly communicate the distinction between the two analyses, highlighting your ability to approach the same problem with varying levels of complexity and sophistication. This is a great way to showcase your skills to potential viewers of your GitHub portfolio!
